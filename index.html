    <h2>Learning to drive</h2>
    <p>For some people, learning to drive can seem like an unachievable goal. Similar to learning to fly a plane or becoming the captain of a ship. For others it's as easy as a walk in the park or riding a bike</p>
    <br>
    <p>The important thing to remember is very simple - Everyone learns at a different pace and in different ways. Some people learn by reading manuals and the theory behind how and why things work, others learn by getting stuck in and improving
      through making mistakes. There's also the people who learn by watching others and putting in to practice what they've seen.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Picking the correct driving instructor for your learning style will help you improve and progress much faster than trying to adjust your learning technique. There's nothing wrong with shopping around for the perfect fit!</p>
