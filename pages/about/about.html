                Good question! <br />
                Deciding to gain your driving licence and make the right
                decisions, you want to know that you're getting information from
                the people in the know.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                My name is Dan, I'm 30 and I currently hold the position of
                Training and Recruitment Officer for a public transport provider
                in the United Kingdom. My main role is to take people with no
                PCV driving experience and make them a safe and confident driver
                with the knowledge and skills to achieve their vocational PCV
                licence enabling them to become bus drivers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I've recieved extensive training in adult learning and training
                techniques for both classroom environments and out on the road,
                I work in strict compliance with the DVSA to ensure the best
                outcome for my trainees.

            <h2>What is Dan's Driver Training?</h2>
            <p>
                I decided to put Dan's Driver Training together to be a
                one-stop-shop resource for learning to drive and obtaining
                additional vocational licences, keeping up to date with the
                latest information and rule changes from the DVSA and DVLA.
